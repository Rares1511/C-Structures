C-structures

Implementation of different data structures such as heap, hash_table, map, queue, etc, in C for an easier access. Every
data structure uses access to a file universal.h and universal.c with functions that all data structures use in their
implementation. For each individual implementation and explanations about using head to the README inside the corresponding
data structure.

As a general note of use extract the archive and copy the intended data structure files alongside universal, afterwards just
include the file .h corresponding to the data structure and follow the individual README for exact use.

Example: Upon wanting to use the vector data structure, extract the archive, copy the folders vector and universal into your
working directory, and in the desired file add #include "C-structures\vector.h"
